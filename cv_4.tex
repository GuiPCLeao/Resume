\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://fieldpro.com.br/}{FieldPRO}}{Apr. 2022 - Present}{Data Engineer and Data Scientist}{}

%\item I got responsible for maintaining and updating the ETL processes to keep the data pipeline working properly. It involved working with \href{https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html}{Celery} to schedule ETL jobs that extract data from several external and internal APIs and databases (mainly \href{https://www.mysql.com/}{MySQL} and \href{https://www.influxdata.com/}{InfluxDB}); with \href{https://git-scm.com/}{Git} to maintain our repositories version history; with \href{https://kubernetes.io/}{Kubernetes} to trigger deploys in our staging and production environments; and with several cloud computing tools available at \href{https://cloud.google.com/}{Google Cloud Platform (GCP)} such as Storage, Logging and Build Engine.

%\item I am also working to constantly improve the rain analysis that we provide to our clients: I improved our rain model used to process precipitation based on several weather variables and impact measurements read by the sensors in our products, and I created a model to merge punctual raining measurements with satellite raining estimates to create a precipitation heat-map in any desired area at the Brazilian territory.

\item Managed and maintained ETL processes to ensure automated and seamless data pipeline operations, utilizing \href{https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html}{Celery} for scheduling ETL jobs to extract data from various APIs and databases.
\item Updated our APIs to give important historical and forecast climate data of the client farm helping them to easily identify crop stage and their needs to improve yield.% For that, I used \href{https://flask.palletsprojects.com/}{Flask} framework in Python and mainly Pandas library for development and I created several new endpoints to provide these kinds of information.
\item Enhanced farm's raining analysis by merging observational measurements with satellite rainfall estimates.
\item Developed a soil moisture estimate model that considers soil parameters and rainfall analysis in order to give insights about growing conditions so actions could be done to avoid crop loss.%. parameters such as the type of soil but also the water inputs and outputs measured by our product.

\begin{rSubsection}{FieldPRO}{Sep. 2021 - Apr. 2022}{Hardware Developer}{}

\item Designed the schematic, defined the Bill of Materials (BOM) and projected the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) of a new version of the product expanding its capabilities to support several communication technologies (GSM, UMTS, LTE, Wi-Fi and satellite), enabling installation in more challenging environments in Brazil.
\item Updated the electrical windsock and anemometer circuits to reduce power consumption and developed a new supply system incorporating rechargeable batteries and solar panels to enhance the weather station's autonomy and minimize maintenance interventions.
%\item Defined the Bill of Materials (BoM) and schematic, and collaborated with the team to project the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the new version of the product.
\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{GreenLab Solutions}{Dec. 2020 - Aug. 2021}{IoT Developer Intern}{}

\item Developed and installed electronics for automated hydroponics growing chamber, where environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature and $CO_{2}$ concentration were monitored and remotely controlled.
\item Designed and programmed firmware for circuits using ESP8266 and ESP32 development boards, connected to various sensors, to monitor and control the internal microclimate of the growing chamber.
%\item Created a remotely controlled humidifier system to maintain minimum climate requirements by increasing relative humidity inside the growing chamber.

\begin{rSubsection}{\href{https://www.fst.tu-harburg.de/institut/willkommen}{TUHH - Institut f\"ur Flugzeug-Systemtechnik}}{Oct. 2019 - Sept. 2020}{Software Developer Intern}{}

\item Extended software-based tools used for cross-validation of aircraft systems, enabling engineers to identify problems and perform trade-offs during early design phases, resulting in reduced changes and cost savings during advanced stages of engineering.
\item Enhanced tools used for validating systems topologies, tasks allocations, and data flows in avionics systems.
%\item I also updated the user interface of the working programs to enhance the process of validating systems topologies, tasks allocations, and data flows in avionics systems. Unity 3D engine, C\# scripting, and .NET framework were used during the process.
%\item Developed scripts to interpret \href{https://cpacs.de/}{CPACS} geometric data and render them using 3D methods like Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) to model desired aircraft models in the program's 3D environment.
